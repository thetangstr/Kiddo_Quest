## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story - Child Experience
As a child user, I want to see my progress through levels and earn badges, so that I feel motivated to complete more quests and build good habits.

### Primary User Story - Parent Experience  
As a parent, I want to understand my children's task completion patterns and behaviors through analytics, so that I can better support their development and adjust rewards appropriately.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Phase 1 - Gamification
1. **Given** a child has earned 500 XP, **When** they complete a quest worth 50 XP, **Then** they should advance to the next level if 550 XP meets the threshold
2. **Given** a child completes quests for 7 consecutive days, **When** viewing their profile, **Then** they should see a "7-day streak" badge
3. **Given** a parent creates a quest, **When** setting it up, **Then** they can assign it to categories (chores, homework, behavior, creativity) and difficulty levels
4. **Given** a child completes a quest, **When** submitting completion, **Then** they can attach a photo as proof

#### Phase 2 - Analytics & Controls
1. **Given** a parent views the analytics dashboard, **When** selecting weekly view, **Then** they see completion rates per child and per quest category
2. **Given** a parent sets up a penalty, **When** a child misses a scheduled quest, **Then** the specified XP is deducted automatically
3. **Given** multiple parents share a household, **When** one parent creates a quest, **Then** other parents can view and approve it before activation
4. **Given** a family has multiple children, **When** viewing analytics, **Then** parents can compare performance trends between siblings

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: XP deduction for penalties brings child below zero]?
- How does system handle photo verification when device has no camera?
- What happens when parents disagree on quest approval in multi-parent households?
- How are streak calculations handled across time zones?
- What occurs when a child reaches maximum level [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: is there a level cap]?
