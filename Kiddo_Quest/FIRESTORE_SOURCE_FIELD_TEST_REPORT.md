# Firestore Source Field Fix - Test Report

**Test Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Environment:** Beta (https://kiddo-quest-beta.web.app)  
**Test Purpose:** Verify that the undefined source field error in Firestore has been resolved  

## Test Summary

‚úÖ **PASS** - The Firestore source field fix is working correctly. The undefined source field error has been successfully resolved.

## Critical Issue Background

**Previous Error:**
```
‚ùå Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field source in document rewards/xxx)
```

**Root Cause:** When creating rewards without Amazon source data, the `source` field was being set to `undefined`, which Firestore rejects.

**Fix Deployed:** Modified the addReward function to properly exclude undefined source fields from Firestore operations.
