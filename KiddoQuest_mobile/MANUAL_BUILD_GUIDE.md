# ðŸŽ¯ Manual Build Guide - Step by Step

## ðŸ”§ Why Builds Aren't Starting

EAS requires **interactive credential setup** for the first build of any project. This is a security feature that can't be bypassed. I can't provide the interactive responses through the CLI, so you need to run the commands manually.

## ðŸ“± Step-by-Step Build Process

### Step 1: Test Configuration
First, let's make sure everything is working:

```bash
cd /Users/Kailor_1/Desktop/Projects/kq_v0.5/KiddoQuest_mobile
eas whoami
eas project:info
```

**Expected Output:**
```
thetangstr
fullName  @thetangstr/kiddoquest
ID        b1de6edc-e799-44d9-bce3-c9eedf49b27d
```

### Step 2: Start Android Build (Easier First)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

**You'll see these prompts:**

1. **"Resolved 'development' environment for the build"** - This is normal
2. **"Using remote Android credentials (Expo server)"** - This is good
3. **"Generate a new Android Keystore?"** 
   - **Type: `y` and press Enter**
   - This creates the signing key for your Android app

4. **"Keystore alias"**
   - **Press Enter** (uses default)

5. **"Keystore password"**
   - **Type a secure password** (remember this!)
   - **Press Enter**

6. **Build will start uploading and processing**

### Step 3: Start iOS Build
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

**You'll see these prompts:**

1. **"Do you want to log in to your Apple account?"**
   - **Type: `n` and press Enter**
   - (We'll use Expo's managed certificates)

2. **"Generate a new Apple Provisioning Profile?"**
   - **Type: `y` and press Enter**

3. **"Generate a new Apple Distribution Certificate?"**
   - **Type: `y` and press Enter**

4. **Build will start uploading and processing**

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

After starting each build:
- **Terminal**: Shows upload progress and build queue status
- **Web Dashboard**: https://expo.dev/builds
- **Build Time**: 10-15 minutes each
- **Notifications**: Email when complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Build Output

### Android (.apk):
- Direct download link
- QR code for installation
- Install on any Android device

### iOS (.ipa):
- Direct download link  
- QR code for installation
- Install on iPhone/iPad (may require device registration)

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### "Command not found"
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd /Users/Kailor_1/Desktop/Projects/kq_v0.5/KiddoQuest_mobile
pwd
```

### "Not logged in"
```bash
eas login
```

### "Invalid project"
```bash
eas project:info
# Should show: @thetangstr/kiddoquest
```

### Build Fails During Upload
- Check internet connection
- Try again (builds can be retried)
- Check EAS dashboard for specific error

## ðŸ“Š Current Configuration Status

âœ… **EAS Account**: thetangstr logged in  
âœ… **Project**: @thetangstr/kiddoquest configured  
âœ… **App Config**: Valid and working  
âœ… **Dependencies**: All installed  
âœ… **Bundle IDs**: Set for both platforms  

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready to Build!

Everything is configured perfectly. The only thing preventing builds is the interactive credential setup, which you need to complete manually.

---

**Commands to run:**
```bash
cd /Users/Kailor_1/Desktop/Projects/kq_v0.5/KiddoQuest_mobile

# Android first (easier)
eas build --platform android --profile development

# Then iOS  
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

**Monitor at**: https://expo.dev/builds

Once you complete the credential setup for the first build, future builds will use the stored credentials automatically!
