# Playwright MCP Testing System

A comprehensive automated testing system that integrates Playwright MCP with Claude Code for seamless testing workflows. This system automatically runs tests when files change and provides detailed feedback on the Phase 1 & 2 gamification features.

## 🎯 Features

- **Auto-Testing Hook**: Automatically runs Playwright MCP tests when files change
- **Targeted Testing**: Runs specific tests based on which files were modified
- **Debounced Execution**: Waits for file changes to settle before running tests
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all Phase 1 & 2 gamification features
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate testing results after code changes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Auto-Testing Hook
```bash
# Start watching for file changes and auto-run tests
npm run test:mcp:hook

# Run tests once without watching
npm run test:mcp:hook:once
```

### 2. Manual Test Execution
```bash
# Run the full Playwright MCP test suite
npm run test:mcp

# Start auto-testing with continuous monitoring
npm run test:mcp:auto
```

## 📁 File Change Detection

The system monitors these file patterns:
- `src/**/*.js`, `src/**/*.jsx`, `src/**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx`
- `src/components/**/*` - UI component changes
- `src/screens/**/*` - Screen and page changes
- `src/utils/**/*` - Utility function changes
- `src/hooks/**/*` - Custom hook changes

### Smart Test Selection
The system automatically determines which tests to run based on file changes:

| Changed File(s) | Tests Triggered |
|----------------|----------------|
| `src/components/gamification/*` | `testGamificationFeatures` |
| `src/components/analytics/*` | `testParentAnalytics` |
| `src/screens/ChildDashboard.js` | `testChildDashboard` |
| `src/screens/ParentAnalytics.js` | `testParentAnalytics` |
| `src/utils/xpCalculator.js` | `testGamificationFeatures` |
| `src/store.js` | `runFullTestSuite` |
| Other files | `testLogin`, `testChildDashboard` |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Timing Settings
- **Debounce**: 3 seconds after last file change
- **Cooldown**: 10 seconds minimum between test runs
- **Test Timeout**: 30 seconds per test scenario

### Test Environment
- **Production URL**: `https://kiddo-quest-de7b0.web.app`
- **Test User**: Pre-configured test account with sample data
- **Browser**: Playwright with Chrome/Chromium

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Scenarios
```javascript
// Add custom test scenarios in auto-playwright-mcp-hook.js
testScenarios: {
  'src/components/custom': ['testCustomFeature'],
  'src/utils/newUtil.js': ['testNewUtility']
}
```

### Integration with Claude Code
The system generates specific prompts for Claude Code Playwright MCP integration:

```javascript
const prompt = `
Use Playwright MCP to test the enhanced child dashboard:
1. Navigate to child dashboard view
2. Look for gamification elements (level display, streak counter, badges)
3. Test quest completion flow
4. Verify XP progress updates
5. Take screenshots of key features
`;
```

## 🚦 Getting Started with Testing

### Step 1: Verify Setup
```bash
# Check if scripts are available
npm run test:mcp:hook --help
```

### Step 2: Run Initial Test
```bash
# Run tests once to verify everything works
npm run test:mcp:hook:once
```

### Step 3: Start Auto-Testing
```bash
# Start the auto-testing hook
npm run test:mcp:hook
```

### Step 4: Make Changes and Watch
1. Edit any file in `src/`
2. Save the file
3. Watch automatic test execution
4. Review test results in console

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Immediate Feedback**: Know instantly if changes break functionality
- **Targeted Testing**: Only runs relevant tests for changed files
