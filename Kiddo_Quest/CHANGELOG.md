## Development Notes

### Authentication Journey
The authentication implementation went through several iterations:
1. **Initial Firebase setup** with basic Google OAuth
2. **Domain configuration challenges** with `.firebaseapp.com` vs `.web.app`
3. **Popup vs redirect authentication** testing and optimization
4. **Google One Tap integration** attempt (later removed for simplicity)
5. **Final simplification** to reliable app page redirection

### Testing Approach
- **Manual testing** with real Google accounts
- **Playwright automation** for consistent flow validation
- **Cross-browser testing** to ensure compatibility
- **Mobile testing** for responsive behavior

### Future Considerations
- Consider implementing Google One Tap when Firebase integration is more mature
- Explore server-side authentication for enhanced security
- Add progressive web app (PWA) capabilities
- Implement analytics and user behavior tracking
