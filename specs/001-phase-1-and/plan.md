## Summary
Implementing comprehensive gamification and analytics features for KiddoQuest family chore management system. Phase 1 enhances child experience with levels, badges, streaks, and visual rewards. Phase 2 provides parents with analytics dashboards, advanced controls, and multi-parent household support. Based on research, will capture child age during profile creation to enable age-appropriate theming.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript/ES6+, React 18  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions), Zustand, Tailwind CSS  
**Storage**: Firestore NoSQL database, Firebase Storage for images  
**Testing**: Playwright (E2E), React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Web (responsive), Mobile web  
**Project Type**: web - React frontend with Firebase backend  
**Performance Goals**: <2s initial load, <100ms interactions, 60fps animations  
**Constraints**: COPPA compliance for children under 13, offline capability  
**Scale/Scope**: 10k families, 50k children profiles, 1M quests/month

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Since no formal constitution exists, using standard best practices:
- ✅ Component-based architecture (React components)
- ✅ State management pattern (Zustand store)
- ✅ Test-driven development (Playwright tests)
- ✅ Security-first (Firebase Auth, role-based access)
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Progressive enhancement

```

**Structure Decision**: Web application pattern with Firebase backend. New features organized in dedicated component folders with corresponding tests. Cloud Functions handle scheduled tasks and analytics processing.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - Badge criteria and types → Research gamification best practices
   - Level progression curves → Research engagement psychology
   - Age-appropriate themes → Research child development stages
   - Notification strategies → Research engagement without addiction
   - Analytics metrics → Research parenting insights needs

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research gamification badge systems for children apps"
   Task: "Find XP progression curves that maintain engagement"
   Task: "Research age-appropriate UI themes for 4-7, 8-11, 12+"
   Task: "Find notification best practices for family apps"
   Task: "Research parenting analytics metrics and KPIs"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`

**Output**: research.md with all clarifications resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Level (thresholds, privileges, icons)
   - Badge (criteria, category, rarity)
   - Streak (start_date, count, type)
   - ChildProfile (extended with age, level, badges)
   - AnalyticsReport (metrics, period, filters)
   - PenaltyRule (trigger, amount, schedule)
   - FamilyGoal (target, progress, members)

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - GET /api/child/{id}/level
   - POST /api/child/{id}/badges
   - GET /api/analytics/reports
   - POST /api/quests/templates
   - PUT /api/rewards/{id}/price
   - POST /api/penalties/rules

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Schema validation tests
   - Authorization tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Child levels up after XP threshold
   - Streak maintained across days
   - Analytics show correct aggregations
   - Multi-parent approval workflow

5. **Update CLAUDE.md incrementally**:
   - Add gamification patterns
   - Add analytics architecture
   - Update recent changes

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Level system implementation tasks
- Badge system implementation tasks
- Streak tracking implementation tasks
- Analytics dashboard creation tasks
- Parent controls enhancement tasks
- Database schema migration tasks
- UI component creation tasks
- Cloud Function setup tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
1. Database schema updates [P]
2. Data models creation [P]
3. State management updates
4. UI components (badges, levels, streaks) [P]
5. Child dashboard enhancements
6. Analytics engine implementation
7. Parent dashboard creation
8. Cloud Functions deployment
9. Integration testing

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md
