# CRUD Operations Testing - Final Report

**Test Date**: January 2025  
**Original Issue**: `❌ Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field source in document rewards/w5b5wyKH1kZMYMugSfEn)`  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Issue Resolution**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Root Cause**: Firestore `addDoc()` and `updateDoc()` operations were trying to save `undefined` values in the `source` field when creating/updating rewards without Amazon product data.  
**Solution**: Implemented conditional field inclusion to only add `source` field when it has valid data.  
**Testing**: Comprehensive CRUD operations verified across Development, Beta, and Production environments.

## 🔧 Technical Fix Implementation

### Problem Analysis
- **Original Error**: `Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field source)`
- **Cause**: Rewards created without Amazon source data had `undefined` source field
- **Impact**: Failed reward creation/updates, poor user experience

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed `addReward` Function (`src/store.js:1057-1070`)
```javascript
// Before: Always included source field (could be undefined)
source: dataToAdd.source, // ❌ Could cause undefined error

// After: Conditional source field inclusion
const firestoreData = {
  ...dataToAdd,
  parentId,
  status: 'available',
  image: imageUrl,
  createdAt: serverTimestamp()
};

// Only add source field if it exists and is not undefined
if (dataToAdd.source !== undefined && dataToAdd.source !== null) {
  firestoreData.source = dataToAdd.source;
}
```

#### 2. Fixed `updateReward` Function (`src/store.js:1149-1162`)
```javascript
// Before: Could include undefined source
source: cleanedData.source || reward.source, // ❌ Potential undefined

// After: Conditional source field handling
const updateData = {
  ...cleanedData,
  image: imageUrl || reward.image,
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp()
};

// Only update source field if it exists and is not undefined
if (cleanedData.source !== undefined && cleanedData.source !== null) {
  updateData.source = cleanedData.source;
} else if (reward.source !== undefined && reward.source !== null) {
  updateData.source = reward.source; // Preserve existing source info
}
```
