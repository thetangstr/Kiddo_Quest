### Mobile-Specific Improvements Identified

1. **Quest Claiming UX Issue**
   - Mobile app has same `set({ isLoading: true })` issue (line 544 in useStore.ts)
   - This causes full UI reload when claiming quests
   - **Fix Required**: Remove global loading state, use local loading per quest

2. **Feedback Button Missing**
   - Mobile app doesn't have feedback submission feature
   - **Fix Required**: Add FeedbackModal component

3. **Navigation Structure**
   - Mobile uses React Navigation (Stack + Tabs)
   - Web uses Zustand `currentView` state
   - **Status**: Properly adapted for mobile

4. **Styling Approach**
   - Mobile uses NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native)
   - Web uses standard Tailwind CSS
   - **Status**: Properly adapted for mobile

## 🐛 Issues to Fix

### High Priority
1. **Quest Claiming Loading State** (Same as web app issue)
   - Remove `set({ isLoading: true })` from `completeQuest` function

   - Ensure proper date formatting for quest completions
   - Add same try-catch protection as web app

3. **Watchman Issue**
